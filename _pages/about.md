Welcome!<br><br>
I'm Rehmat, wannabe Physicist, coffee <s>addict</s> lover, and amateur wordsmith.<br>
I'm currently working on my Masters thesis at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/theoretical-physics/">Imperial College London</a>, for my MSc in Physics with Extended Research. Previously, I did an undergraduate in Engineering <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>. I hope to pursue a PhD in Physics in the near future.<br><br>
My research is currently focused on Higher-Form Electromagnetism and Generalised Symmetries, but I am broadly interested in Theoretical Fundamental Physics and Mathematical Physics. Some topics I would mention are symmetries and anomalies, resurgence, and RG flows. I'm also interested in discrete quantum geometries as approaches to quantum gravity, quantum information in holography, and asymptotic symmetries of spacetimes. I especially enjoy finding connections between different topics, and adapting mathematical and computational techniques across them.<br><br>
When not buried in Physics or code, you might find me reading, writing poetry, or brewing coffee. Explore this website for a taste of my life and work!
