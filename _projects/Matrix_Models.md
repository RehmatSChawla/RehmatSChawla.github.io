An internship under Dr Victor Mishnyakov, Stockholm University, as part of the NORDITA Summer Internship Program, 2025.

- Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for Matrix Model computations, eg Wilson loops in representations $$\mathrm{Sym}^k,\Lambda^k$$
- Studied how supersymmetric localisation connects Wilson loops in $$\mathcal N=4$$ SYM to Matrix Models
- Using Wilson loops in large-$$N$$, large-$$k$$ limit as a test of the $$\mathrm{AdS}$$/CFT Correspondence
