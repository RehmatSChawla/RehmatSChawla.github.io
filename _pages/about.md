Welcome!<br><br>
I'm Rehmat, wannabe Physicist, coffee <s>addict</s> lover, and amateur wordsmith.<br>
I'm currently completing my undergraduate studies in Engineering Physics at <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>, and hope to pursue a PhD in Physics in the near future.<br><br>
My research is currently focused on Topological Quantum Field Theories and Medical Imaging, but my interests span a wide variety of fields, including Quantum Field Theories, Lattice Field Theory Simulations, and Quantum Information. I especially enjoy finding connections between different fields, and adapting mathematical and computational techniques across them.<br><br>
When not buried in Physics or code, you might find me reading, writing poetry, or brewing coffee. Explore this website for a taste of my life and work!
