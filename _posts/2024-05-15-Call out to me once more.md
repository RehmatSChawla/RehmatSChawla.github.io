As I obtained my degree and left IIT Bombay for what might be the last time as a student, I struggled to reach the sadness through the sheer surrealness of the idea. I may be back someday, briefly, but I will be different, and so will the people. The endless days spent on those roads are now at an end. I'm still trying to process this, and so I turned, as I often do, to poetry:

<div class="poem">
<b>Call out to me once more</b><br><br>Call out to me once more<br><br>O rows of desks and lecture halls,<br>Call out to me once more<br>O empty roads and rambling walks,<br>Call out to me once more<br>O noisy score from room next door,<br>Call out to me once more<br>O tree-rimmed lake-edged home off home,<br>Call out to me once more.<br><br>O hours spent slogging, arduous days,<br>Interspersed with coffee breaks<br>Rants erupted, tea was spilled<br>A camaraderie most singular built<br>O baubled ceilings, nights of vice<br>Company till crack of light<br>Through sanguine love and pardoned hate<br>We forged these friendships â€˜spite of fate<br><br>O petrichor and sunset-smote<br>O rooftop scenes and days of birth<br>O frenzied clicks and lectures slow<br>O laughs familiar and smiles adored<br>O haunted rooms and vaunted halls<br>Give me reason to come home<br>O memory-laden mud and walls <br>Call out to me once more.<br></div>
