Ambition has always driven me to do more and be more, but there have been a few unforgettable moments in my life when I realised it is simply not enough. Time runs out. You sacrifice, or you compromise. And sometimes you must walk away.

<div class="poem">
<b>I walk away</b><br><br>They smile and wave, all dressed up<br>A Friday night, so the agenda<br>Is to take a break, dance the night away<br>I walk up the hill to where equations lay<br><br>They call my name, and slow me down,<br>Music sounds, a band’s in town,<br>I stop, and ponder, turn around,<br>"Sorry guys, I’ll sit this one out."<br><br>And I walk away<br>And I wish I’d stayed<br><br>Cheers and groans follow answers<br>They practice, it’s triumph they’re after<br>Home, out of place, I’m guilt and mistakes,<br>I should atone, work longer, learn faster<br><br>And I walk away<br>And I wish I’d stayed<br><br>Suitcases line the bus stop<br>Last-minute checks and rushed walks<br>"There’s an empty seat," they say to me<br>But I just stick around till they drive off.<br><br>And I walk away<br>And I wish I’d stayed<br>And I wish I could stop, and take a break<br>Could stay with the people I ache to be with<br>Give them more than seconds snatched in haste<br>But I run each day, and I get nowhere,<br>And if I stop, a failure stay<br>So I walk away<br>I refuse to stay<br>My ambition’s tall<br>And discipline frail<br>All I’ve got is this stubborn denial of pain<br>So I’ll exploit it again and again till I’m great</div>
