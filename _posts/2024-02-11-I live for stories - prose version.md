(Warning, this is more of a prose piece.)
</div>

Self-identity is always a nebulous concept, and one I've struggled with a fair bit. But occasionally I will write a piece that crystalises many of my broodings about my idea of self. This is one of them.

<div class="poem">
<b>I live for stories</b><br><br>Bidding goodnight to the table, I swung my bag onto my back and hopped off the raised platform of the roadside Chaayos and begun the walk back to my room. But as I put on my spectacles, an unusual figure came into focus - my course professor, with whom I’d had an enlightening discussion on tangent spaces in manifolds that very morning. He looked at the table I had just left, laughing uproariously in the dead of night, and back at me. “Is this how you live? How absurd.” He said, judgingly. “Are you surprised, because you thought I was a dedicated student?” “Or else you would be napping in the backbenches in my class, if you were gallivanting with this crowd all night.” I shook my head. “Maybe you’re guessing based on certain people you’ve seen, who live for the fun, the ruckus and the parties. Maybe you thought I live for my work, and the ambitions that drive me. I live for neither of those.” “Then what do you live for?”<br>The poetry I told him then, I’ll tell you word for word.<br>“I live for stories. The ones you raise glasses to, or whisper furtively. The ones told at nighttime with eyes bleary, the gossip you save for afternoon tea, the dinnertime tall tales and the anecdotes exchanged over coffee.<br>I live for stories, so I read like possessed (and occasionally, watch movies). I visit worlds galore and return exhilarated or teary, and I keep wanting more. Maybe I’ll write one myself, we’ll see.<br>I live for stories. In Physics I find the stories of the world I’m exploring, and in Maths the stories my kind write to make sense of things, and when I find the sense too much to make sense of, I turn to writing out the nonsense in my head into poetry.<br>I live for stories, and people are not so much characters, but rather bundles of stories. So I keep all my kin, and I listen with intent, because everyone has tales to tell, places they’ve been and things they’ve felt. I judge a wardrobe by its tshirts, not the dress shirts that bay for glory.<br>I live to tell stories - be a storyteller - turns out there’s a performer in me. When I hold the stone I’ll spin tall tales to leave you amazed and dumbstruck and mortified (sorry). And so in everything in my life I seek stories, and every day of mine I could make a story, and when there’s a choice so bold it’d make a story worth being told, then I make it, and it’s risky, but I’ve got the devil’s luck with me.<br>I live for stories. And secretly, I dream of being a story - living a life worth talking about, a legacy worth posterity. Therein lies my drive, the ambition that pushes me. And there’s decades to go and many false starts to forgo, but one day I’ll be a story - one others dream to be, or one they read themselves to sleep.”<br></div>
