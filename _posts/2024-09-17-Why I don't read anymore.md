A friend once coined the phrase "Bibliophile (non-practicing)" to describe us grown-up bookworms — but as everyone around me has gotten over the slump, I still struggle to make time for what was my most treasured hobby just 7-8 years ago. So I wrote about it, as I do.

<div class="poem">
<b>Why I don't read anymore</b><br><br>My bookshelf stands at my bedside, a hundred titles a stretch away<br>It’s been there for years, but what were once rows familiar<br>Are now adorned with twenty spines unknown, and thirty more I call “to be read”<br>How did I go from stroking the pages<br>To reaching only for the phone charger among them?<br>Or else the perfume on the top shelf<br>People and reels now consume my days<br><br>Before I could pocket a screen, I hungered for words<br>On the way back from the bookstore<br>Half a sentence per streetlamp<br>That flashed through the car window<br>And dinner, and the bus, and the dance lessons I could not care less for<br>All dedicated to the words and the worlds within<br><br>I ache to go back<br>But I also don’t<br>Because the chef in me itches to see more recipes<br>The quizzer in me desires to hoard more facts<br>The linguistics nerd in me wants more etymology<br>The coffee addict aficionado seeks a better brewing technique<br>Born with the personal computer, I’m passionate about the power of these machines and of a world that exploits them fully<br>A romantic, I can never have enough of hope, prose or poetry<br>And having known friendship, who could go back to solitude?<br>So it goes<br>Always a book with me, scarcely opened<br>Its words and worlds, to me unknown<br>Mostly a ghost, haunting me<br>With the me who has now grown to be more<br><br>He still lives, the hungry kid<br>Comes to visit, every now and then<br>He never stays long<br>But the bookmark still moves<br></div>

The poem doesn't talk about the future, or about hope. I couldn't fit it in there. But I do still hope that I'll be back someday. Someday I'll curl up with a book and not realise the sun went up or down, and I'll get up with a sore back, insane hunger and an unpennable satisfaction of having finished an emotional rollercoaster. I can't wait.
